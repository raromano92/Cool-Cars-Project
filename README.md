SEi 5/9 Project #2

Premise:
This is a Full Stack CRUD application that allows a user to have their own personal car collection specific to them. They can create new entries if they find a new car that they like and store for the future in case one day they would like to purchase it! Enjoy checking out some of the coolest rides out there!
